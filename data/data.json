Give yourself time to look around and assess your choices. When you see a flat that suits your budget and needs, take your time to inspect the flat and its condition before deciding on the purchase. Other matters Other than the flat price, there are other matters you must consider when you negotiate with the flat sellers: Deposit comprising Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee You must pay flat sellers an Option Fee when they grant you an Option to Purchase (OTP), and an Option Exercise Fee when you exercise the OTP. You may negotiate the amounts of Option Fee and Option Exercise Fee with the flat sellers, which will form part of the resale price.

Submission of resale application Under Clause 12 of the OTP, you and the sellers must agree on the timeframe to submit the resale application to HDB. This is a contractual term between you and the sellers. Once it is agreed upon, it may be varied only with mutual consent. Please submit the resale application as soon as possible to minimise unforeseeable changes, e.g. EIP and SPR quotas, untoward events, etc. Extension of stay To ease sellers\u2019 transition to their next home, sellers may arrange with you to extend their stay temporarily in the flat, for up to 3 months after the resale completion. The temporary extension of stay is subject to your agreement. If you agree, the minimum occupation period that you have to fulfil after the flat purchase will start only when the sellers have moved out of your flat. Enhanced Contra Facility If you are planning to sell your existing HDB flat and buy another resale HDB flat, you may consider applying for the Enhanced Contra Facility (ECF). This facility allows you to use the cash proceeds and refunded CPF savings from the flat sale and complete the purchase of your next flat at the same time. Take note that if you are applying for the ECF when buying your next flat, the buyers of your existing flat and the flat sellers of your intended resale flat purchase will not be able to apply for ECF for their respective flat purchases. Any other matters For example, will the sellers leave behind any furniture or appliances?

You may be eligible to buy a flat if: You and the flat seller are of the same ethnic group and household citizenship; or After your flat purchase, the number of households of your ethnic group remains within the block and neighbourhood limits. In addition, for non-Malaysian SPR households, the number of SPR households remains within the SPR quota. Check your eligibility You may use our e-Service to check if you are eligible to buy an HDB resale flat in a particular block or neighbourhood under the EIP/ SPR quota. The prevailing EIP and SPR quotas for the month are also displayed on the resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. The quotas are updated on the 1st of each month. Please check to ensure compliance with the EIP/ SPR quota at each of the following milestones: Flat sellers grant the Option to Purchase (OTP); You exercise the OTP; and You and the flat sellers submit the respective portion of the resale application. * A resale application is completed only when HDB receives both the buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 portions of the resale application and the necessary supporting documents. About the EIP The EIP is put in place to preserve Singapore\u2019s multi-cultural identity and promote racial integration and harmony. It ensures that there is a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in HDB towns. The EIP limits are set at block and neighbourhood levels based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. For the purchase of an HDB flat, a household with members of different ethnic groups may choose to classify their household ethnicity under the ethnicity of any buyer(s) or spouse according to the race shown on their NRIC. Once an ethnicity is chosen for the household, it will remain the same when the flat owners subsequently sell their flat on the open market. About the SPR quota The SPR quota ensures that SPR families can better integrate into the local community. Malaysians are excluded from this quota because of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. Non-Malaysian SPR households applying to buy an HDB resale flat need to be within the SPR quota for the block (8%) and neighbourhood (5%)."}, {"page_url": "https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/plan-source-and-contract/mode-of-financing", "page_category": "Mode of Financing", "page_section": "Main", "page_char_count": 1178, "page_word_count": 205, "page_sentence_count_raw": 10, "page_token_count": 294.5, "texts": "Mode of Financing Plan your finances and work out your budget before you search for a suitable home.

Once that limit is reached, you will not be able to withdraw more of your CPF savings and have to pay the balance flat purchase price and/ or monthly mortgage instalments in cash The total amount of CPF savings that can be used for your flat purchase and/ or paying monthly mortgage instalments will depend on the extent the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer up to the age of 95.
